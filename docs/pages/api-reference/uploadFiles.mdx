# uploadFiles

A small helper for implementing file uploads which reports progress for each uploaded file.

## Example source code

```tsx filename="main.tsx"
import { uploadFiles } from "@xixixao/uploadstuff";

const uploaded = await uploadFiles({
  // A list of File objects
  files,
  // The upload URL string
  url,
  onUploadProgress: ({ file, progress }) => {
    // file is the file name string
    // progress is a multiple of 10 between 10 and 100
  },
  onUploadBegin: ({ file }) => {
    // ...
  },
});
// The result is list of objects with
// name:  the file name string
// type: the file type string
// size: the file size in bytes
// response: whatever your upload API returns for each file
```
