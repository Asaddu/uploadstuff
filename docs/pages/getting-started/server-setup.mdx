# Getting started on the server

We'll be using [Convex](https://convex.dev) to implement our file storage, but
you could use any means of generating an upload URL, as long as you can
authorize it.

## Setting up Convex functions for file upload

We'll use 2 [mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions):
The first one generates an upload URL, the second one saves the file storage ID
in our database.

<Steps>

### Create a mutation that generates an upload URL

This mutation basically defines an endpoint that gives our UI a URL to upload
files to. It can also:

- Verify that the user is authorized to upload files

```ts filename="convex/files.ts"
import { mutation } from "./_generated/server";

export const generateUploadUrl = mutation({
  args: {
    // ...
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // use `args` and/or `ctx.auth` to authorize the user
    // ...

    // Return an upload URL
    return await ctx.storage.generateUploadUrl();
  },
});
```

### Create a mutation that saves the file storage ID

The second endpoint will be called after the file upload is complete, to save
the uploaded files' storage IDs and any metadata in our database. It can also:

- Reverify that the user is still authorized to upload the file
- Limit the number of uploaded files
- Limit the file size

export const saveStorageId = mutation({
  // You can customize these as you like
  args: {
    storageId: v.id("_storage"),
    // other args...
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // use `args` and/or `ctx.auth` to authorize the user
    // ...

    // Save the storageId to the database using `insert`
    await ctx.db.insert("someTable", {
      storageId: args.storageId,
      // ...
    });
    // or `patch`/`replace`
    await ctx.db.patch(someId, {
      storageId: args.storageId,
      // ...
    });
  },
});
```

    storageIds: v.array(
      v.object({
        storageId: v.string(),
      }),
    ),
    // other args...
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // use `args` and/or `ctx.auth` to authorize the user
    // ...

    // Save the storageId to the database using `insert`
    await ctx.db.insert("someTable", {
      storageIds: args.storageIds.map(({ storageId }) => storageId),
      // ...
    });
    // or `patch`/`replace`
    await ctx.db.patch(someId, {
      storageIds: args.storageIds.map(({ storageId }) => storageId),
      // ...
    });
  },
});
```

</Steps>

In your project you can give these mutations more specific names based on your
use case, and you can create multiple pairs of mutations for different file
uploading use cases you might have in your app.

With these mutations in place, you're ready to use one of the provided APIs to
implement file uploading in your app's UI.
