# What is UploadStuff?

UploadStuff is the easiest way to add file uploads to your full stack TypeScript application. Many services have tried to build a "better S3", but in our opinion, none found the right compromise of ownership, flexibility and safety.

Doing this well involves getting three key pieces correct: **File Hosting**, **Server-side Authorization**, and **Client Experience**.

## 1. Use managed file hosting

UploadStuff is agnostic of the hosting provider, but we strongly recommend [Convex](https://convex.dev).

## 2. Authorize users on YOUR server

You can't let just anyone upload files to a storage provider which you pay for. You should authorize uploads on the server. [Convex](convex.dev) makes this really easy.

## 3. Give users a great experience

UploadStuff is an open-source JavaScript and React library for uploading files from your frontend with convenient components, hooks and more. There's an `<UploadButton />` and `<UploadDropzone/>` for super easy implementation. With `useUploadFiles` you can implement your own custom component. And `uploadFiles` can be used from any JS application.

## Wait, I've seen this before!

UploadStuff is a play on and a fork of [UploadThing](https://uploadthing.com/).
